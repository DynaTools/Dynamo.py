## Select filtered elements

This method will also allow the creation of an object of type user interface for filtering the selected elements. These interfaces cannot be instantiated, so it will be mandatory to create an object directly inheriting its methods and properties.

This will open the possibility of keeping the desired objects regardless of the set of elements that have been selected. Here is an instance where only the walls of a selected set of elements will be selected.
