# Elements Intersecting a BoundingBox with Tolerance

## Overview
This filter allows you to define a tolerance (Double) as an argument and also provides the option to invert the filter with a Boolean value.

## Basic Usage

### Filter elements intersecting a bounding box:
```python
Filter = BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(outline)
elems = FilteredElementCollector(doc, doc.ActiveView.Id).WherePasses(Filter).ToElements()
```

### Filter with tolerance:
```python
Filter = BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(outline, tolerance, False)
elems = FilteredElementCollector(doc, doc.ActiveView.Id).WherePasses(Filter).ToElements()
```

## Detailed Explanation
### Tolerance
Tolerance allows for flexibility in determining intersections. The tolerance is specified in the same units as the bounding box. For instance, if your document is in feet, the tolerance should be in feet as well. This allows for slight adjustments and errors in modeling to be accounted for.

### Invert Filter
The Boolean argument inverts the filter. When set to `True`, the filter will return elements that do not intersect the bounding box.

## Advanced Examples

### Using Inverted Filter:
```python
Filter = BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(outline, tolerance, True)
elems = FilteredElementCollector(doc, doc.ActiveView.Id).WherePasses(Filter).ToElements()
```
In this example, `elems` will contain all elements that do **not** intersect the bounding box within the specified tolerance.

### Dynamic Tolerance Based on Element Size:
```python
tolerance = 0.1 * someElement.Size
Filter = BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(outline, tolerance, False)
elems = FilteredElementCollector(doc, doc.ActiveView.Id).WherePasses(Filter).ToElements()
```
Here, the tolerance is dynamically calculated as 10% of some element's size, allowing for scalable tolerance adjustments.

## Now Your Turn

### Exercise Project
Let's practice creating a project that uses BoundingBox intersection filters with tolerance. The goal is to solidify understanding through practical exercises.

#### Exercise 1: Basic Filter
1. Create a new view in Revit.
2. Use the basic filter to find all elements intersecting a defined BoundingBox.
3. List these elements in the console output.

#### Exercise 2: Filter with Tolerance
1. Define a tolerance of 0.5 units.
2. Modify the original BoundingBox to include the tolerance.
3. Use the filter to find elements that intersect the BoundingBox with the applied tolerance.
4. List these elements in the console output.

#### Exercise 3: Inverted Filter
1. Use the original BoundingBox without tolerance.
2. Apply the filter with the `invert` argument set to `True` to find elements that do not intersect the BoundingBox.
3. List these elements in the console output.

#### Exercise 4: Dynamic Tolerance
1. Select an element and calculate a tolerance based on its size (e.g., 10% of the element's size).
2. Create a BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter using this dynamic tolerance.
3. Use the filter to find elements that intersect the BoundingBox with this dynamic tolerance.
4. List these elements in the console output.

## Conclusion
Understanding and utilizing BoundingBox intersection filters with tolerance in Revit can significantly enhance your ability to manage and analyze elements within your models. Practice these exercises to become proficient in applying these filters effectively.
